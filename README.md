# The Group Theory Game

The idea is to develop basic group theory from scratch in Lean, and to
write all proofs in tactic mode other than a few primitive ones
hidden from the user. The interesting question is: precisely which tactics
do I want to use to do this stuff? And is it possible to teach the tactics from the ground up or do the players need to have played some of the natural number game?
